                           <p class="oj-normal">The growth of electronic commerce (‘e-commerce’) facilitates the cross-border sale of goods and services to final consumers in the Member States. In that context, cross-border e-commerce refers to supplies upon which the VAT is due in a Member State, but the supplier is established in another Member State, in a third territory or in a third country. However, fraudulent businesses exploit e-commerce opportunities in order to gain unfair market advantages by evading their VAT obligations. Where the principle of taxation at destination applies, since consumers have no accounting obligations, the Member States of consumption need appropriate tools to detect and control such fraudulent businesses. It is important to combat cross-border VAT fraud caused by the fraudulent behaviour of some businesses in the area of cross-border e-commerce.</p>

In order to provide payment services, a payment service provider holds specific information to identify the recipient, or payee, of the payment together with details of the date, the amount and the Member State of origin of the payment as well as of whether the payment was initiated at the physical premises of the merchant. That specific information is particularly important in the context of a cross-border payment where the payer is located in one Member State and the payee is located in another Member State, in a third territory or in a third country. Such information is necessary for the tax authorities of the Member States (the ‘tax authorities’) to carry out their basic tasks of detecting fraudulent businesses and controlling VAT liabilities. It is therefore necessary that payment service providers make that information available to the tax authorities to help them detect and combat cross-border VAT fraud.</p>

When such identifiers are not available, the location of the payer or the payee should be determined by means of a business identifier code of the payment service provider acting on behalf of the payer or the payee, in cases where the funds are transferred to a payee without any payment account being created in the name of a payer, where the funds are not credited to any payment account of the payee or where there is no other identifier of the payer or the payee.</p>

With regard to information relating to the payee and the payment itself, payment service providers should only be required to retain and report to the tax authorities information which is necessary for those authorities to detect possible fraudsters and to carry out tax controls. Payment service providers should therefore be required to keep records only on those cross-border payments which are likely to indicate economic activities. The introduction of a ceiling based on the number of payments received by a payee over the course of a calendar quarter would give an indication whether those payments were received as part of an economic activity, thereby excluding payments for non-commercial reasons. Where such a ceiling is reached, the record keeping and reporting obligations of the payment service provider would be triggered.</p>

Since the objective of this Directive, namely to combat VAT fraud, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States individually if there is a cross-border element, and due to the need to obtain information from other Member States, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>
